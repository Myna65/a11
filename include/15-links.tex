\subsection{CPR graphs}

\paragraph{}
CPR graph were introduced by Pellicier in~\cite{cprGraph}.

\begin{definition}[CPR graph]
  Let $P$ be a regular polytope of dimension $d$ and let $\pi$ be an embedding of the automorphism graph of $\Gamma$ into $S_n$ for some $n$. The C-group permutation representation graph or CPR graph of $P$ is a labeled multigraph with vertices ${1 \dots n}$, labels ${1 \dots d}$ such that there is an edge of label $k$ between $i$ and $j$ if $(\pi \rho_k)i = j$.
\end{definition}
