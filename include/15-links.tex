\subsection{Permutation representation graphs}

\paragraph{}

\begin{definition}[Permutation representation graph]
  \index{permutation representation graph}
  Let $\mathcal P$ be a regular polytope of dimension $d$ and let $\pi$ be an embedding of the automorphism graph of $\Gamma$ into $S_n$ for some $n$. The permutation representation graph of $P$ is a labeled multigraph with vertices ${1 \dots n}$, labels ${1 \dots d}$ such that there is an edge of label $k$ between $i$ and $j$ if $(\pi \rho_k)i = j$.
\end{definition}

Permutation representation graphs were introduced by Pellicier in~\cite{cprGraph} under the name "CPR graph". He requires an additional condition that the group satisfies the intersection property. But given the graph, it is not easy to check whether it is a C-group or not. Therefore we choosed to remove the intersection condition and call it "permutation representation graph".

\begin{property}
  \label{intersection-patterns}
  Let $\Gamma = \langle \rho_0, \dots \rho_n \rangle$ be a permutation representation graph of a regular polytope $\mathcal P$, and let $|i - j| \ge 2$. Then every connected component of $\Gamma_{\rho_i,\rho_j}$ is either a single vertex, a single edge, a double edge or an alternating square.
\end{property}

For the proof see the proposition 3.5 of~\cite{cprGraph}.
