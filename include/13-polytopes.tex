\section{Polytopes}

This section follow the book \cite{polytopes}

\begin{definition}[$\mathcal V$-polytope]
  A polytope is a bounded intersection of a finite number of closed half-plane.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$\mathcal H$-polytope]
  A polytope is a bounded intersection of a finite number of closed half-plane.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  A subset $P \subseteq \mathbb R^d$ is a $\mathcal V$-polytope iff it's a $\mathcal H$-polytope.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{}
There are two ways to represent polytopes and the most adapted representation will be used in every statement.

\paragraph{}
We can write equation of the half planes in the form $Ax \le c$. Each half plane can be summarized as a couple $(A,c)$. If we index the half planes by $i$, we have that a polytope is the set of points $x$ such that $A_i x \le c_i$ for all $i$.

\begin{definition}[Valid inequality]
  An inequality $ax \le c$ is valid for a polytope $P$ if it's satisfied for all points $x \in P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Face of polytopes]
  The faces of a polytopes $P$ are the intersection between $P$ and the hyperplane determined by $ax = c$ where $Ax \le c$ is a valid inequality. By convention, $P$ itself is also a face of $P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Face lattice]
  We can define a poset of the faces of every polytope. Given two faces $F$ and $G$ of $P$, we say that $F \le G$ iff $F \subseteq G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Every face lattice is a poset.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  Every face lattice is a lattice.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  Every face lattice is a ranked lattice and the dimension of the faces is a good rank function.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[Diamond property]

\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $P$ be a convex polytope and $L(P)$ its face lattice $L(P)$:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $L(P)$ is a graded poset of length $\dim(F) + 1$ with rank function : $\rank(F) = \dim(F) + 1$.
    \item Every interval $[G,F]$ of $L(P)$ is a face lattice of a convex polytope of dimension $\dim(F) - \dim(G) - 1$
    \item ("Diamond property")\index{diamond property} Given two faces $F$ and $G$ of $P$ such that $\dim(F) = \dim(G) - 2$ there exist exactly two faces $H_1$ and $H_2$ such that $F < H_1 < G$ and $F < H_2 < G$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
